# How Swift Observation Works

A deep dive into the internals of the Observation framework.

## Overview

The Observation framework provides a revolutionary approach to property observation in Swift. Unlike traditional patterns that require explicit registration and management of observers, Observation uses compile-time transformations and runtime tracking to provide automatic, fine-grained property observation.

## The Core Problem

Traditional observation patterns in Swift have significant limitations:

- **KVO (Key-Value Observing)**: Requires Objective-C runtime, type-unsafe string keys, and complex boilerplate
- **Combine**: Heavy framework dependency, requires explicit publishers for each property
- **Property Wrappers**: Can't track which specific properties are accessed

The Observation framework solves these issues by providing:
- Fine-grained, type-safe property observation
- Automatic tracking of only accessed properties
- Zero boilerplate for basic usage
- Cross-platform compatibility

## The @Observable Macro Magic

When you mark a class with `@Observable`, a sophisticated transformation occurs:

```swift
// What you write:
@Observable class Car {
    var name: String = "Tesla"
    var speed: Int = 0
}

// What the macro generates:
class Car {
    // Original property becomes computed with special accessors
    var name: String {
        @storageRestrictions(initializes: _name)
        init(initialValue) { 
            _name = initialValue 
        }
        
        get {
            access(keyPath: \.name)  // Track property access
            return _name
        }
        
        set {
            withMutation(keyPath: \.name) {
                _name = newValue
            }
        }
        
        _modify {
            access(keyPath: \.name)
            _$observationRegistrar.willSet(self, keyPath: \.name)
            defer { 
                _$observationRegistrar.didSet(self, keyPath: \.name) 
            }
            yield &_name
        }
    }
    
    // Backing storage (hidden from public API)
    @ObservationIgnored private var _name: String = "Tesla"
    
    // The observation machinery
    @ObservationIgnored private let _$observationRegistrar = ObservationRegistrar()
    
    // Helper methods for tracking
    internal nonisolated func access<Member>(
        keyPath: KeyPath<Car, Member>
    ) {
        _$observationRegistrar.access(self, keyPath: keyPath)
    }
    
    internal nonisolated func withMutation<Member, MutationResult>(
        keyPath: KeyPath<Car, Member>,
        _ mutation: () throws -> MutationResult
    ) rethrows -> MutationResult {
        try _$observationRegistrar.withMutation(of: self, keyPath: keyPath, mutation)
    }
}

extension Car: Observable {}
```

## The Tracking Mechanism

The tracking system uses thread-local storage to transparently record property accesses:

### Step 1: Setting Up Tracking Context

```swift
withObservationTracking {
    // Code that accesses properties
    print(car.name)
    print(car.speed)
} onChange: {
    // Called when tracked properties change
    print("Car properties changed!")
}
```

### Step 2: Thread-Local Storage

When `withObservationTracking` executes:

1. A thread-local pointer is set to an `_AccessList`
2. This list will collect all property accesses within the closure
3. The pointer is visible to all code executing on the same thread

### Step 3: Property Access Recording

When you access `car.name`:

1. The property getter calls `access(keyPath: \.name)`
2. `access` checks for thread-local tracking context
3. If found, it records the keyPath in the `_AccessList`
4. The actual property value is returned normally

### Step 4: Observer Registration

After the tracking closure completes:

1. The collected `_AccessList` contains all accessed properties
2. Observers are registered ONLY for these specific properties
3. The `onChange` closure is stored for later execution

### Step 5: Change Detection

When a tracked property changes:

1. `willSet` is called before the mutation
2. The actual value is updated
3. `didSet` is called after the mutation
4. All registered `onChange` closures fire once

## The ObservationRegistrar

The `ObservationRegistrar` is the central hub managing all observations for an object:

### Key Responsibilities

- **State Management**: Maintains a map of observers to properties
- **Registration**: Handles observer registration and cancellation
- **Notification**: Triggers observer callbacks on property changes
- **Cleanup**: Automatically removes observers when no longer needed

### Observer Types

The registrar supports four types of observations:

1. **willSetTracking**: Called before property changes
2. **didSetTracking**: Called after property changes
3. **computed**: For computed property observers
4. **values**: For value-based observations

### Lifecycle Management

Observers are automatically cleaned up when:
- The tracking is explicitly cancelled
- The observed object is deallocated
- The observation fires (for one-shot observations)
- The tracking context goes out of scope

## Design Decisions Explained

### Why Thread-Local Storage?

Thread-local storage enables transparent tracking without API changes:

- No need to pass context through every property access
- Scoped to current execution context
- Automatically cleaned up when scope exits
- No interference between threads

### Why Separate Backing Storage?

The backing storage pattern (`_name` for property `name`) enables:

- Intercepting all property access
- Maintaining source compatibility
- Fine-grained control over getters/setters
- Avoiding infinite recursion in accessors

### Why Only Classes?

The framework only supports classes because:

- Reference semantics are required for observation
- Structs would need to copy observers on mutation
- Actors have complex isolation requirements
- Enums don't have mutable storage

## Performance Characteristics

The Observation framework is designed for optimal performance:

### Lazy Registration
- Observers only registered for accessed properties
- No overhead for unobserved properties
- Registration happens after access tracking

### One-Shot Notifications
- `onChange` fires once per mutation cycle
- Multiple property changes coalesce
- Reduces unnecessary UI updates

### Automatic Cleanup
- No manual observer removal needed
- No retain cycles with proper usage
- Memory-efficient observer storage

### Lock-Free Design
- Uses critical sections only for state mutations
- No locks during property access
- Minimal contention in multi-threaded scenarios

## Advanced Features

### @ObservationIgnored

Excludes specific properties from observation:

```swift
@Observable class Model {
    var tracked: String = "I'm observed"
    @ObservationIgnored var ignored: Int = 42  // Never tracked
}
```

### @ObservationTracked

Explicitly marks properties for tracking when not using `@Observable`:

```swift
class PartiallyObservable {
    @ObservationTracked var observed: String = "tracked"
    var normal: Int = 0  // Not tracked
}
```

### Nested Tracking

Observations can be nested - inner tracking contexts merge with outer ones:

```swift
withObservationTracking {
    // Outer tracking
    print(model1.property)
    
    withObservationTracking {
        // Inner tracking
        print(model2.property)
    } onChange: {
        // Fires for model2 changes
    }
} onChange: {
    // Fires for model1 OR model2 changes
}
```

## Real-World Usage Pattern

Here's a complete example showing typical usage:

```swift
@Observable class ViewModel {
    var items: [Item] = []
    var isLoading = false
    var errorMessage: String?
    
    func loadData() async {
        isLoading = true
        errorMessage = nil
        
        do {
            let data = try await fetchItems()
            items = data
        } catch {
            errorMessage = error.localizedDescription
        }
        
        isLoading = false
    }
}

// In your UI layer
class ViewController {
    let viewModel = ViewModel()
    
    func setupObservation() {
        withObservationTracking {
            // Only track properties we actually use
            if viewModel.isLoading {
                showLoadingSpinner()
            } else if let error = viewModel.errorMessage {
                showError(error)
            } else {
                showItems(viewModel.items)
            }
        } onChange: {
            // Re-render when any tracked property changes
            Task { @MainActor in
                self.setupObservation()  // Re-establish observation
            }
        }
    }
}
```
